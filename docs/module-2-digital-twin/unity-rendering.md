# High-Fidelity Rendering in Unity

While Gazebo is excellent for physics simulation, Unity is often used for high-fidelity rendering and creating immersive human-robot interaction scenarios.

## Unity for Robotics

- **Photorealistic Rendering:** Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) can produce stunningly realistic visuals, which is important for training vision-based AI models on synthetic data.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Unity's rich UI and interaction capabilities make it a great tool for developing and testing HRI scenarios.
- **ROS-Unity Integration:** Tools like the [ROS-TCP-Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector) allow Unity to communicate with ROS 2, enabling co-simulation where Gazebo handles the physics and Unity handles the rendering and user interaction.
