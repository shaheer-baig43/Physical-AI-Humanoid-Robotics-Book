# Weeks 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development

These weeks are dedicated to the specifics of developing for humanoid robots.

- **Humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics:** Delve into the mathematics of how humanoid robots move, including forward and inverse kinematics.
- **Bipedal locomotion and balance control:** A major challenge in humanoid robotics is walking and maintaining balance. We will explore various control strategies to achieve stable bipedal locomotion.
- **Manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands:** Learn about the complexities of controlling a multi-fingered robotic hand to grasp and manipulate objects.
- **Natural human-robot interaction design:** Discuss principles for designing interactions that are intuitive and comfortable for humans.
