# Weeks 6-7: Robot Simulation with Gazebo

During these two weeks, you will learn how to simulate robots and environments using Gazebo.

- **Gazebo simulation environment setup:** Get Gazebo installed and configured, and learn how to create a basic simulation world.
- **URDF and SDF robot description formats:** Understand how to describe your robot's physical properties using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and SDF (Simulation Description Format).
- **Physics simulation and sensor simulation:** Learn how to configure Gazebo's physics engine and add simulated sensors like cameras and LiDAR to your robot.
- **Introduction to Unity for robot visualization:** A brief look at how Unity can be used for high-fidelity visualization as a complement to Gazebo.
