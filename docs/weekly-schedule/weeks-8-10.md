# Weeks 8-10: NVIDIA Isaac Platform

These weeks will focus on NVIDIA's powerful suite of tools for robotics.

- **NVIDIA Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim:** Get an overview of the Isaac ecosystem and learn how to use Isaac Sim for photorealistic, physically-accurate simulation.
- **AI-powered perception and manipulation:** Explore the various AI models and tools available in Isaac for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and robot manipulation.
- **Reinforcement learning for robot control:** Learn the basics of how reinforcement learning can be used to train robots to perform complex tasks in simulation.
- **Sim-to-real transfer techniques:** A key focus of the Isaac platform is enabling a smooth transition from simulation to a physical robot. We will discuss techniques to bridge the "reality gap."
