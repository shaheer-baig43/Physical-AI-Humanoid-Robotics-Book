# Week 13: Conversational Robotics

This week focuses on integrating conversational AI with your humanoid robot.

- **Integrating GPT models for conversational AI in robots:** Learn how to connect your robot's systems to large language models like GPT to enable more natural and flexible conversations.
- **Speech recognition and natural language understanding:** Use tools like OpenAI Whisper to convert spoken words into text and then process that text to understand user intent.
- **Multi-modal interaction: speech, gesture, vision:** Explore how to combine different modes of communication for a richer human-robot interaction experience.
