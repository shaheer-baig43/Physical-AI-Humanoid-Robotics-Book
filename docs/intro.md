# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Course Overview

**Focus and Theme:** AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.

**Goal:** Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students will apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
*   Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence.
*   Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control.
*   Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity.
*   Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform.
*   Design humanoid robots for natural interactions.
*   Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics.
