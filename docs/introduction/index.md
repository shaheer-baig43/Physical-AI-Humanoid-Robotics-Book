# Introduction

## Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

### Foundations of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence
*   Definition and principles of Physical AI.
*   Concept of embodied intelligence and its importance.
*   Historical context: from symbolic AI to physical agents.

### From Digital AI to Robots that Understand Physical Laws
*   Challenges and opportunities in deploying AI in the physical world.
*   Understanding real-world constraints (physics, uncertainty, safety).

### Overview of Humanoid Robotics Landscape
*   Current state of humanoid robots (e.g., Boston Dynamics Atlas, Unitree H1, Tesla Bot).
*   Applications and future outlook.

### Sensor Systems
*   Detailed introduction to common robot sensors:
    *   LIDAR (principles, types, data output).
    *   Cameras (monocular, stereo, RGB-D, event cameras).
    *   IMUs (accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers).
    *   Force/torque sensors (tactile sensing, proprioception).
*   Lab: Basic sensor data visualization (simulated).
