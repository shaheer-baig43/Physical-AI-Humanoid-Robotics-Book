# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

This module culminates in the capstone project, where you will build an autonomous humanoid robot in simulation.

## Project Goal

The final project is to create a simulated robot that can perform the following sequence of actions:
1.  Receive a voice command (e.g., "get me the water bottle").
2.  Plan a path to the object's location.
3.  Navigate through the environment, avoiding obstacles.
4.  Identify the correct object using computer vision.
5.  Manipulate the object (e.g., pick it up).

This project will require you to integrate concepts from all four modules of the course.
