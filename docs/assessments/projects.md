# Assessments and Projects

Throughout this course, your learning will be assessed through a series of projects. These projects are designed to give you hands-on experience with the concepts and technologies covered in each module.

## Graded Assessments

- **ROS 2 Package Development Project:** You will develop a ROS 2 package to control a simple robotic system. This will involve creating custom nodes, topics, and services.

- **Gazebo Simulation Implementation:** You will create a Gazebo simulation of a robot in a custom environment. This project will test your ability to work with URDF models and simulate sensors.

- **Isaac-based Perception Pipeline:** This project will require you to build a perception pipeline using NVIDIA Isaac ROS. You will implement features like VSLAM or object detection.

- **Capstone: Simulated Humanoid Robot with Conversational AI:** The final capstone project integrates all the concepts from the course. Details can be found on the [Capstone Project](./capstone.md) page.
