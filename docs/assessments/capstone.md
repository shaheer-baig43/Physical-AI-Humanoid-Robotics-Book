# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

The capstone project for this course is the culmination of all the skills learned throughout the quarter. Students will work on creating an autonomous humanoid robot in a simulated environment.

## Project Description

A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.

## Key Tasks

- Integrate voice recognition (e.g., OpenAI Whisper) to understand high-level commands.
- Use a Large Language Model (LLM) for cognitive planning to break down the command into a sequence of executable actions.
- Implement path planning and navigation using Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement.
- Utilize computer vision to identify and locate target objects within the environment.
- Program the robot to manipulate the object (e.g., pick it up, move it).
- A comprehensive demonstration of the final, integrated system.
