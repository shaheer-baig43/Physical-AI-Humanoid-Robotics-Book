# NVIDIA Isaac Sim

**NVIDIA Isaac Sim** is a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool that powers the NVIDIA Isaac™ platform. It is built on NVIDIA Omniverse™.

## Core Capabilities

- **Photorealistic Simulation:** Isaac Sim leverages the power of NVIDIA RTX technology to create highly realistic, physically-accurate simulations. This is crucial for training and testing robots in a wide variety of environments and scenarios.
- **Synthetic Data Generation (SDG):** It can generate large-scale, high-quality, and cost-effective synthetic datasets to train perception models. This data is often used to train computer vision algorithms for tasks like object detection and segmentation.
- **Sim-to-Real:** Isaac Sim is designed to facilitate the transfer of learned behaviors from simulation to real-world robots. By accurately modeling sensors and physics, it reduces the "reality gap."
- **ROS/ROS 2 Integration:** It has built-in support for ROS and ROS 2, making it easy to integrate with existing robotics software.
