## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - RAG Chatbot Interaction (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to ask questions related to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics and receive accurate, contextually relevant answers generated by an AI chatbot, so I can quickly find information and learn about the topic.

**Why this priority**: The RAG Chatbot is a core interaction method for accessing information within the Docusaurus book, directly enabling the primary goal of knowledge dissemination.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by posing various questions related to the book's content (e.g., about specific robotics concepts, AI applications) and verifying that the chatbot provides correct and relevant answers, demonstrating value by facilitating information retrieval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the Docusaurus book website, **When** I enter a question related to Physical AI, **Then** the chatbot displays a relevant and accurate answer derived from the book's content.
2.  **Given** I am on the Docusaurus book website, **When** I enter a question related to Humanoid Robotics, **Then** the chatbot displays a relevant and accurate answer derived from the book's content.
3.  **Given** I am on the Docusaurus book website, **When** I enter a question in Urdu, **Then** the chatbot displays a relevant and accurate answer in Urdu.

### User Story 2 - Personalized Content Viewing (Priority: P2)

As a returning user, I want the Docusaurus book to remember my progress, preferences, and frequently accessed topics, so I can resume my learning journey seamlessly and discover content tailored to my interests.

**Why this priority**: Personalization enhances user engagement and retention by providing a more customized and efficient learning experience, building upon the core RAG chatbot functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a user interacting with the book, closing the session, and then re-opening it to observe if previous reading progress is maintained, and if recommended content aligns with previously viewed topics, demonstrating value by improving the user's long-term interaction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I have viewed several chapters in the Docusaurus book, **When** I revisit the book, **Then** my reading progress is remembered, and I can easily navigate back to the last chapter or section I was reading.
2.  **Given** I have frequently interacted with content on a specific topic (e.g., robot locomotion), **When** I visit the book's homepage or a recommendations section, **Then** I see suggestions for related content.

### User Story 3 - Secure User Authentication (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to securely log in to the Docusaurus book platform with robust authentication, so my personalized data and progress are protected and accessible only to me.

**Why this priority**: Secure authentication is foundational for enabling personalization and other user-specific features, ensuring data privacy and system integrity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new account, logging in, logging out, and attempting to log in with incorrect credentials or as another user, demonstrating value by protecting user data and providing exclusive access to personalized features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am a new user, **When** I register for an account, **Then** I can successfully create an account and log in using my credentials.
2.  **Given** I am a registered user, **When** I attempt to log in with incorrect credentials, **Then** the system displays an appropriate error message and denies access.
3.  **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I log out, **Then** my session is terminated, and I am no longer able to access personalized content.

### User Story 4 - Urdu Language Content (Priority: P3)

As a user who prefers Urdu, I want to read the Docusaurus book content and interact with the chatbot in Urdu, so I can access the information in my native language.

**Why this priority**: Urdu language support expands the reach and accessibility of the platform to a broader audience, complementing the core content and interaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching the website's language to Urdu and verifying that the main content, navigation, and chatbot responses are correctly displayed in Urdu, delivering value by making the platform accessible to Urdu speakers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the Docusaurus book website, **When** I select Urdu as my preferred language, **Then** the book content, navigation, and chatbot interface are displayed in Urdu.
2.  **Given** I am interacting with the chatbot in Urdu, **When** I ask a question in Urdu, **Then** the chatbot responds with a relevant answer in Urdu.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user asks a question to the RAG chatbot that is completely outside the scope of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"? The chatbot should indicate that it cannot answer.
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to user personalization data (e.g., reading progress)? The system should ensure data consistency and prevent loss of user progress.
- What happens if an unauthorized user attempts to access personalized data? The system must deny access and potentially log the attempt.
- How does the system handle content that is not yet translated into Urdu? It should gracefully fallback to English or indicate unavailability.
